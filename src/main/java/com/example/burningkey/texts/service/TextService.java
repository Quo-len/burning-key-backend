Born into a community where opportunities were scarce, Walter worked tirelessly to carve out a path of success for himself and his family. A gifted chemist, he once harbored dreams of making groundbreaking contributions to science, hoping to uplift his community and provide a better future for his loved ones. Walter's academic brilliance led him to co-found a promising startup, Gray Matter Technologies. However, feeling marginalized and unappreciated by his co-founders, who often overlooked his contributions, he left the company early on. This decision, driven by a sense of injustice and pride, haunted him as Gray Matter grew into a billion-dollar enterprise without him. His departure from the company marked the beginning of a series of missed opportunities and unfulfilled dreams. Years later, Walter was working as an overqualified high school chemistry teacher, struggling to make ends meet. His wife, Skyler, worked as a bookkeeper, and they had two children: Walter Jr., who had cerebral palsy, and their infant daughter, Holly. The familyâ€™s financial situation was dire, and the burden weighed heavily on Walter. When he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, the prognosis was a death sentence that came with a final, crushing blow to his hopes and dreams.")
